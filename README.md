## Hi there 👋

I'm INiNiDS, a Rustacean with a love for Unreal Engine and game development.  
Currently brewing cool projects like **WikiSearch Bot**.  
I code, I experiment, I learn — and sometimes break things 😅

## About Me

- ✍️ I'm currently working on my new project **GemEXP** – an unofficial open-source Android app-alternative to the official Gemini app, featuring extended functionality.
- 🧑‍🏫 Going to learn and use **C++ with Unreal Engine optimized!**
- 🙌 My name is pronounced like **I**, **Ni Ni**, **DS** → yes, yes like **INiNiDS** :)
- 😊 Fun Fact:
  > I started learning programming because of Discord.  
  > I just met a man who made Discord bots. I decided to give it a try, it was fun!  
  > I started with BDFD, then found Python thanks to a friend.  
  > But in the end, GameDev stole my heart ❤️
